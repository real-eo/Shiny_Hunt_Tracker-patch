<h1>Important!</h1>

**THIS REPO WAS FORKED FROM [adamsb0303s SHINY HUNT TRACKER](https://github.com/adamsb0303/Shiny_Hunt_Tracker)!**

Almost all of the source was written by adamb0303, so credit to him. My edits are highlighted with comments. There is also a more detailed guide on how to use the program in his repo's readme.md. All the changes made by me should be seemless unless specified.

<h2>Why the fork?</h2>

The reason why i decied to make my own fork of this amazing program was to remove the limitation of having to be tabbed into the program to have the keybinds update the counter, along other QOL updates.

<h2>Features</h2>

- A global key listener to register keyboard events so the counter updates even while the program isn't focused
