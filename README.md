<h1>NOTE!</h1>
**THIS REPO WAS FORKED FROM [adamsb0303s SHINY HUNT TRACKER](https://github.com/adamsb0303/Shiny_Hunt_Tracker)!**

<h2>Why the fork?</h2>
The reason why i decied to make my own fork of this amazing program was to remove the limitation of having to be tabbed into the program to have the keybinds update the counter, along other QOL updates.
